# Blume E-commerce Business Analytics Project
👉[Blume_Report.pdf](Blume_Report.pdf)


---
In this project, I built a realistic e-commerce analytics case study using simulated Shopify-style transaction data based on real product pricing from Blume (itsblume.com), a Vancouver-based wellness brand.

The goal was to practice the type of analysis a Business Analyst Intern would do: revenue trends, pricing, profitability, churn, and forecasting.

- Analyze the impact of discounts on order value

## Key Insights 

- Superbelly Hydration and Superfood Latte drive most of Blume’s revenue  
- Bundles represent 16 % of orders but increase average order value  
- Subscription churn is highest in the first 1–3 months  
- Gross margins stay in a realistic 55–65% range across categories

## Notes & Limitations

This project uses simulated transaction data based on real product pricing and general e-commerce benchmarks.

Blume’s internal costs and customer behavior are not publicly available, so this project is meant for educational portfolio purposes.
